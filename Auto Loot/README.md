# Auto Loot

Auto Loot is the most configurable auto loot, auto harvest, and auto steal mod for Fallout 4.

* With Auto Loot, you can automatically loot Ammo, Bodies, Containers, Drinks, Flora, Food, Junk, Medicine, and Valuables.
* You can automatically send that loot to any settlement, your inventory, or mix and match.
* Plus, you can configure all aspects of Auto Loot while in the game using a Pip-Boy holotape.

With the in-game menu, you can:

* Control which loot filters you want activated.
* Control the auto loot radius for each filter. Every filter has its own radius!
* Control the auto loot container for each filter. (30 settlements x 9 filters!)
* Control which items are auto looted from bodies and containers.
* Control whether you always keep loot processed by specific filters.
* Control whether filters suspend processing while in settlements.
* Control whether filters ignore ownership. This is Auto Steal!
* Control whether Auto Steal can trigger combat when you are detected.
* Control whether Auto Steal loots only owned items or owned and unowned items.
* Control the rates at which each filter processes the world.
